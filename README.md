# Summary:
In Program A, you'd need to update a single array, the index reference in the 'calculations' for loop, and the data output rows. 
In Program B, you'd need to update the length for 3 arrays, the index reference in the 'calculations' for loop, the index reference in the output for loop, and the data output rows. That makes Program B more difficult to update than Program A. Steve would need to evaluate what program properties are most important to him when deciding which program to adopt.
